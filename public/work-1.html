			<p>Taster's Club wanted to extend the popular 'Wine of the Month' model to their true passion, whiskey. No one knows whiskey more than these guys, so they seemed like the right ones to do the job.</br></br>

Their goals were to have a super-classy website to generate interest and take signups. They wanted it to be refreshing, engaging and clearly communicate the value of their business.</br>

We helped them get off the ground with not only a kick ass landing page, but also a sleek admin app to handle all their subscriptions on the back-end.
